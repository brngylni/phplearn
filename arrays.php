/* 
	Array : Data holders that take sequential datas that we enter or 
	that some sequential values are assigned with the operation of the program.
	
	print_r():It prints arrays as we can read.

	Rules:
	1: Arrays would be created with "array()" or "[]".
	2: Key names that defined in arrays have to include alfanumeric values (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) or "_" (underscore).
	3: Space , Turkish Characters or any special character cannot be used in key names which defined in arrays.
	4: While defining the key names to arrays, we can't use the names that already in use by PHP.
	5: Key names that defining to arrays are responsive to upper-lower cases.
	6: Key names that defining to array components can't be multiple used in same array.
	7: Ä°f we wouldn't define the key names to arrays components, it'd be automatically define the key names to each array component.It'd take numerically values for each component and it'd start from 0 and increase one by one.

	Structure: 
	array(Key => Component, Key => Component, Key =>Component...);
	array(Component, Component, Component...);
